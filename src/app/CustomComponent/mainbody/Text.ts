    description : "<b>Problem Statement:</b> Creating a suitable metric to identify the ecological behaviour of students and help the educators evaluate the curriculum on how well it incorporates nature-based environment education and healthy behaviour among students.<br/><br/><b>Description:</b>The core idea behind this project is to assess individual student based on their ability to connect to environment and be knowledgeable of it, promote good environmental practices and also general healthy behaviour to help them become a green citizen of future.<br/><br/><p>The problem it solves is inadequate nature-based education that doesnot provide adequate examples and ability for students to connect with nature. Since they are future citizen, it is important such values are created from the fundamental important part in life - schools. This project provides for continuous assessment of individuals to identify ideas and promote nature-based innovations and also helps educators to model the curriculum for better outcome on nature-based behaviour parameters.</p>It gives a general consensus and statistical inference based on a pre-trained model based on data collected from student's activity.The solution is clearly stated and the project purpose and basic functionality are mapped to the opportunity area.<br/><br/><b>Reference journal:</b> <a href='https://www.journals.elsevier.com/global-environmental-change'>Global Environmental Change</a>"
